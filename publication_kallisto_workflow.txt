Use a workflow with default user defined parameters - Kallisto-Bustools, made for scRNAseq data.

In the lncRNA paper, the authors used the following versions:
	- Cell Ranger count was run in version 3.0.1
	- STAR in version 2.7.9
	- Kallisto in version 0.46.1
	- Bustools in version 0.40.0
	- Salmon in version 1.4.0

Human genome version: hg38 (v37), Kallisto was indexed against the transcriptome.

scRNAseq quality control, gene detection and post-processing:
	- Specically, emptydrops was applied to distinguish empty droplets from cells in each dataset processed with Kallisto.
	- Potential doublets were then identifed and removed with scDblFinder.
	- Finally, cells with high mitochondrial content and an abnormally high number of counts were also filtered.
	- Next, poorly expressed genes were also filtered by applying a gradient of thresholds on the expression. The different thresholds applied retained those genes with more than 
		1) 250 counts and present in more than 25 cells
		2) 100 counts and present in more than 10 cells
		3) 50 counts and present in more than 5 cells
		4) 25 counts and present in more than 3 cells
	- These thresholds were also applied in the characterization of the genes exclusively identified by Kallisto compared to genes commonly found ones.
	- After the quality control was completed, normalization was performed using logNormCounts function from scuttle R package.
	- Dimensionality reduction was conducted using runPCA, runTSNE and runUMAP functions from scater R package.
	- Next, clustering was performed on a generated shared nearest-neighbor (SNN) graph using the Louvain community detection algorithm to cluster the cells.
	- These clusters were manually annotated to cell types using canonical markers (Supplementary Data 1).
